This a basic POC HTML project

Very minimal CSS applied

It has three pages which are linked

There are navigations within the pages too to different sections

Also, the structure of HTML semantics is followed.

Special thanks to FreeCodeCamp and Dave Gray as usual.

Thank you and Thank Tacos. Muchas Gracias (hope that was correct)!
